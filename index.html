                    <p>This text set includes informational texts, infographics, and a video. All deal with the ideal of equal voting rights and the steps taken to ensure those rights.</p>
                    <p><i><span class="bold">The Path to Voting Equality</span></i> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <i><span class="bold">The Path to Voting Equality</span></i> for independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where specific text structures and features appear across the texts in this set.</p>

                    <p>Before students begin reading the texts in this set, engage them in a class discussion around the Big Question.</p>
                    <p>Why is the right to vote important? How does the right to vote make it possible for people to change the world?</p>
                    <p>Have you seen news coverage of people protesting for certain rights? Why are rights worth fighting for?</p>
                    <p>What is something about society that you wish was different? Do you feel that you can make that change happen? Could you make a change if many more people were helping you?</p>

                    <p>Discuss with students the words <i><span class="bold">poll</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">protest.</span></i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting"> The word <span class="bold">poll</span> has a few different meanings, but in this text, it refers to voting. Maybe you have heard the term polling places. That means places where people go to vote.</span>. Ask students if they have ever spoken out about something they disagreed with. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">When you say that something is wrong, you are <span class="bold">protesting</span>. A protest can be one person disagreeing with someone, or it can be a larger group of people organized to speak out about an issue.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Oral Vocabulary</span> <i>Civil Rights at the Polls</i> features words that might be new or challenging to some students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">Black Americans campaigned to have the same <span class="bold">opportunities</span> as white Americans. It was a hard struggle, partly because the courts often <span class="bold">ruled</span> that unjust laws were fair.</span> </p>

When they read <i>Civil Rights at the Polls,</i> encourage them to add words to their web that relate to the word protest. A web for protest might look like this:</p>
                    <p>[a word web with <i>protest</i> in the center, and with <i>democracy, unfair,</i> and <i>equality</i> branching from it]

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> <i>Civil Rights at the Polls</i> has a chronological text structure.

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Writers of informational texts will sometimes use section heads. These heads can help group information into sections and give the reader an idea of what information is coming next.</span> Project or direct students to the head “Organizing for Change” on p. 5. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Based on this head, what do you think the next section of text will be about?</span>

                    <p>Ask students to share their word sorts and explain why they connected the words the way they did. Students may sort words based on their own experiences, so accept all reasonable explanations for the connections they make.</p>

They might choose a new law that is being debated, or an issue of public policy. For example, a proposal for a new park or new school, or school uniforms.</p>
                    <p>Have them come up with a plan for how they will make people aware of the issue and encourage the most people to vote. Their campaigns should include catchy slogans, posters and signs, and plans for where and when to peacefully demonstrate to spread the word.</p>
                    <p>Students can refer to what they wrote in Write About the Big Question for each text to aid their thinking and planning.

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
